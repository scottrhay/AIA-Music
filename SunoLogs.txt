advice you wage war\\nand in many counselors there is victory.\\nWisdom is unattainable for a fool—\\nhe does not open his mouth at the gate.\\nOne who plots evil will be called a schemer.\\nA foolish scheme is sin,\\nand people detest a mocker.\\nCounsel on Friendship\\nIf you falter in a day of adversity,\\nyour strength is small.\\nRescue those being dragged off to death,\\nhold back those

with rebels.\\nFor their destruction will arise suddenly,\\nand who knows the ruin both ADONAI and the king can bring?\\nThese sayings are also from the wise:\\nPartiality in judgment is not good.\\nWhoever tells the guilty,\\n“You are innocent,” people curse him and nations revile him.\\nBut for those who convict the guilty there will be delight—\\ngood blessing will come upon them.\\nAn

not deceive with your lips.\\nDo not say, “I will do to him what he has done to me;\\nI will pay him back for his deed!”\\nLesson of the Lazy\\nI passed by the field of the slacker,\\nby the vineyard

schemer.\\n9 The devising of foolishness is sin,\\nAnd the scoffer is an abomination to men.\\n10 If you faint in the day of adversity,\\nYour strength is small.\\n11 Deliver those who are drawn toward death,\\nAnd hold back those stumbling to the slaughter.\\n12 If you say, “Surely we did not know this,”\\nDoes not He who weighs the hearts consider it?\\nHe who keeps your soul, does He not know it?\\nAnd will He not render to each man according to his deeds?\\n13 My son, eat honey because it is good,\\nAnd the honeycomb which is sweet to your taste;\\n14 So shall the knowledge of wisdom be to your soul;\\nIf you have found it, there is a prospect,\\nAnd your hope will not be cut off.\\n15 Do not lie in wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous;\\nDo not plunder his resting place;\\n16 For a righteous man may fall seven times\\nAnd rise again,\\nBut the wicked shall fall by calamity.\\n17 Do not rejoice when your enemy falls,\\nAnd do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles;\\n18 Lest the LORD see it, and it displease Him,\\nAnd He turn away His wrath from him.\\n19 Do not fret because of evildoers,\\nNor be envious of the wicked;\\n20 For there will be no prospect for the evil man;\\nThe lamp of the wicked will be put out.\\n21 My son, fear the LORD and the king;\\nDo not associate with those given to change;\\n22 For their calamity will rise suddenly,\\nAnd who knows the ruin those two can bring?\\nFurther Sayings of the Wise\\n23 These things also belong to the wise:\\nIt is not good to show partiality in judgment.\\n24 He who says to the wicked, “You are righteous,”\\nHim the people will curse;\\nNations will abhor him.\\n25 But those who rebuke the wicked will have delight,\\nAnd a good blessing will come upon them.\\n26 He who gives a right answer kisses the lips.\\n27 Prepare your outside work,\\nMake it fit for yourself in the field;\\nAnd afterward build your house.\\n28 Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause,\\nFor would you deceive with your lips?\\n29 Do not say, “I will do to him just as he has done to me;\\nI will render to the man according to his work.”\\n30 I went by the field of the lazy man,\\nAnd by the vineyard of the man devoid of understanding;\\n31 And there it was, all overgrown with thorns;\\nIts surface was covered with nettles;\\nIts stone wall was broken down.\\n32 When I saw it, I considered it well;\\nI looked on it and received instruction:\\n33 A little sleep, a little slumber,\\nA little folding of the hands to rest;\\n34 So shall your poverty come like a prowler,\\nAnd your need like an armed man.\",\"source_audio_url\":\"https://cdn1.suno.ai/42e0fdd0-5a19-471d-83a7-fd6b85dbb640.mp3\",\"source_image_url\":\"https://cdn2.suno.ai/image_42e0fdd0-5a19-471d-83a7-fd6b85dbb640.jpeg\",\"source_stream_audio_url\":\"https://cdn1.suno.ai/42e0fdd0-5a19-471d-83a7-fd6b85dbb640.mp3\",\"stream_audio_url\":\"https://musicfile.api.box/NDJlMGZkZDAtNWExOS00NzFkLTgzYTctZmQ2Yjg1ZGJiNjQw\",\"tags\":\"\\\"Genre:

Layered analog‑style synths, atmospheric guitars blended into the mix, pulsing arpeggios, and wide futuristic pads. Clean but aggressive production with saturation, compression, and cinematic tension. Vocals are intense, emotional, and urgent, with breath‑driven delivery and occasional robotic or vocoder‑style harmonies. Mood is introspective, dramatic, futuristic, and determined, focusing on connection, pressure, identity, resilience, or internal conflict. No profanity.
